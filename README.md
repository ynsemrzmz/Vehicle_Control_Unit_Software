# Vehicle_Control_Unit_Software
 
 Vehicle control unit can obtain all the data of the electric car then send this data to hmi board and telemetry interface. We have used Nextion HMI to show data to pilot and we have used LoRa module to send data to telemetry interface. (I have shared telemetry interface in another repository)
